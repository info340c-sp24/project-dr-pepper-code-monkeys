        <p id="desc" class="fs-5">
          Find Food Seattle was created with the goal of increasing access to government and private
          programs and events providing free or subsidized food, as well as serving as a space to
          connect businesses like restaraunts and stores who are looking to give away extra food to
          those who need it. We aim to do this by creating an interactive easy-to-use map of different
          food banks, and allow users to find assistance in nearby zip codes. Additionally, we plan to
          create a message board that allows for free advertisement of events that center around
          providing free food, as well as direct messaging between those looking to give away food
          regularly and individuals / organizations that request it.
