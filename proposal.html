            Philanthropist Esther Ndichu, in her TED Talk, said that,
            "hunger isn't a food issue, it's a logistics issue."
            Across Washington, 8.3 percent of households were experiencing food
            insecurity. This statistic notably doesn't account for the homeless
            population of Seattle, which includes tens of thousands of people
            who struggle with finding meals.

            There are many organizations that have been built to assist
            with the logistical troubles of providing food to unhoused people,
            but despite this the issue still persists. Although many drives are
            available to offer assistance and accept donations, the
            relationship between donators, food banks, and those who use
            food banks has yet to be centralized within one platform.
            There is also no consistent platform for promoting food
            drive events, which may dissuade people looking to
            donate if they cannot find a receiver near them.

            is an app dedicated to providing immediate access and
            knowledge of social services to its users. Although this app is
            useful, and has a feature where users can look up food banks
            near them, the App lacks a website with the same function.
            By creating a platform based on the web, users who don't
            have access to an iOS or Android device could still find
            this service through avenues like public library computers
            or devices purchased through government programs like
            <a href="https://connectall.org/">ConnectAll</a>.
            This problem space involves establishments accepting food
            donations and those who use those establishments,
            as well as potential donators.
