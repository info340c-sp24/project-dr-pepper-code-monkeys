        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Philanthropist Esther Ndichu, in her TED Talk, said that,
            "hunger isn't a food issue, it's a logistics issue."
            Across Washington, 8.3 percent of households were experiencing food
            insecurity. This statistic notably doesn't account for the homeless
            population of Seattle, which includes tens of thousands of people
            who struggle with finding meals.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many organizations that have been built to assist
            with the logistical troubles of providing food to unhoused people,
            but despite this the issue still persists. Although many drives are
            available to offer assistance and accept donations, the
            relationship between donators, food banks, and those who use
            food banks has yet to be centralized within one platform.
            There is also no consistent platform for promoting food
            drive events, which may dissuade people looking to
            donate if they cannot find a receiver near them.
        </p>

            <a href="https://www.shelterapp.org/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiMmwBhDmARIsABeQ7xQnW9l0QrGC5hXSSpYDU0hWeGW2tB0JcSTfvSuNJsiqUaXcXQ8pxdsaAt8lEALw_wcB">ShelterApp</a>
            is an app dedicated to providing immediate access and
            knowledge of social services to its users. Although this app is
            useful, and has a feature where users can look up food banks
            near them, the App lacks a website with the same function.
            By creating a platform based on the web, users who don't
            have access to an iOS or Android device could still find
            this service through avenues like public library computers
            or devices purchased through government programs like
            <a href="https://connectall.org/">ConnectAll</a>.
            This problem space involves establishments accepting food
            donations and those who use those establishments,
            as well as potential donators.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>The users of this application will include Seattle-based food donors
            (restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals) with excess food who
            want to donate to prevent waste and support others in their community;
            food banks, organizations, or individuals seeking food donations; and
            other volunteers who may offer transportation help for the food. This
            app would have a significant impact on minority communities, especially
            low-income communities, by improving access to food resources, and thus,
            reducing food insecurity in the Seattle area.</p>

        <p>The first significant feature of this web app will allow users
            (food donors) to post and input details about the excess food they may
            have, including type, quantity, pictures, expiration dates, and
            location/delivery preferences. This way of posting has the potential
            to introduce new potential donors who work at private businesses to
            cast a wide net when looking for places to donate their excess food.
            The second significant feature of this web app will be a chat feature
            that allows users looking to pick up donated food to coordinate with
            the initial poster, allowing for a direct line of communication between
            donors and recipients to clarify details and coordinate food pickup.
            This will allow for food arrangements to be made quickly and accurately.
            The additional smaller feature will be a search and filter function that
            enables users to find available donation postings that meet their specific
            needs, such as food type, proximity, and expiration date, making it easier
            to source out food. The type of food sold by a given distributor can be
            filtered, allowing easier access for those looking for food donations with
            an allergy or other dietary restriction. </p>

        <p>On our platform, users will encounter information in the form of
            listings of available food donations, including descriptions,
            quantities, and locations; and chat messages between donors and recipients.
            The app aims to mitigate food waste and insecurity by establishing a direct
            link between those with surplus food and those in need. It promotes a community-driven
            approach, nurturing a culture of mutual aid in the Seattle area, and
            streamlining the process of food distribution.</p>
